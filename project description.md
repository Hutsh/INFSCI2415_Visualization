**UCI Life Sciences Data** 

 

**Project Description**

 

**Data Set**

 

The data are to be acquired from the UCI repository for Life Science Data  statistics website at <https://bit.ly/2REQ6TG>.

There are 21 categories of data and stats to select from.  Using data from this website, you are to choose two or more data sets to analyze.  

 

**Report Contents**

2. **[3 pages or more]** Visualizations with complete descriptions with axis labels (if appropriate), and legends for colors or marker types.  The implementation is to be done in a programming language such as Matlab. **R or Python are acceptable alternatives -- Any other languages or visualization packages must be approved by the instructor.**
3. **[2-4 pages]** Written text that includes observations of relationships in the data that are visually evident.
4. **[1-4 pages]** An appendix that includes the code or interactive commands (for example, Matlab, R, Python) or interactive commands that were used to generate the visualizations.  These can be screenshots if necessary.
