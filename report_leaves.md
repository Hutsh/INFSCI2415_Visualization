# Information Visualization Final Project: One-hundred plant species leaves data set Data Set

## Data description

One-hundred plant species leaves data set Data Set  is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/One-hundred+plant+species+leaves+data+set ). This dataset consists of one-hundred varieties of leaves. For each variety, 16 examples of leaves were collected;`(Mallah, Cope and Orwell, 2013)` The leaves were placed on a white background, and processed via semiautomated method. Three different features were created, consist of a shape signature, an interior texture feature histogram and a fine-scale margin feature histogram. Three features are stored separately in three files, each file has 64 columns and 1600 rows(total 100 species, 16 rows for each species).



The dataset package that we can download from UCI repository consists two parts: image and
